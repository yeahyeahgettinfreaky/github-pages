    <h1><font color="white">Hello, welcome to cotordo games</font></h1>
    <p><font color="white">Hi, I'm Djalroid, and I like to make games. I have made different types in my experience, such as:</font></p>
    <h2><font color="white">Scratch Games</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">My introduction to scratch was at aproxamatly 3 am, Tuesday, some time in 2019.</font></p>
    <p><font color="white"> This was my first exposure to game dev, because it was so easy, I even used turbowarp to compile in to a nwjs exe file</font></p>
    <h2><font color="white">GameMaker</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">When you want something the you can use to make games, what do you search up?</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">well, I wanted mario maker, but for games from scratch, so I searched up <font color="green">"Game Maker Free"</font></font></p>
    <p><font color="white">I used GML visual to make a platforming demo, this was the first REAL game engine I used, even though it never went anywhere</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">I did, however, go back to it recently for a challenge. GameMaker is not the engine to use if your like me.</font></p>
    <h2><font color="white">Unity</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">I use Unity currently. I first used it in 2020(i think, TBH i cant remember), april. and at first, I used bolt (now known as "unity visual scripting") it was similar to GML visual</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">now, I program in c#(unity's native language). the language was easy to pick up on. voids are your best friend, and semicolons are annoying.</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">Now Unity's description WILL be longer, because I have been using it for 2 years now. My first project was a crappy platformer with even crappier collisions</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">now, I am working on an rpg platformer similar to cave story. It is styled after Super Mario World and pizza tower, with an emphisis on story</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">Another current project that I'm working on is breakout paradise. breakout paradise is breakout but with a shop for new balls, and realistic physics.</font></p>
    <p><font color="white">This project was mainly meant to test my programming skills and see what it takes to release a fun game.</font></p>
